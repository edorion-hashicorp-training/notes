The Culture Map

Key communication context takeaway
- spectrum from low to high in general terms is east to west
- tip: document what is being or has been done clarifying it's there for future reference so to bridge low to high context communication

- probably more self reflective to personal style. like to think i match cultures subcontoiusly as i can be both contextually low and high


Competing with unicorns

- where does support sit in a mission based product methodology (unicorn)?
  - I would suggest support's role in a mission based org is as important inwardly facing as externally facing in comparison to a project one as not only are we focused on customers support but also assisting facilitate a product teams learning?
- What is our mission?
  - I would suggest it is that of the vault product teams not that of a support org

i lol'd as i remember a previous boss telling me he doesn't trust anyone

funny when you said don't be a rockstar, but it's a cultural self validation that working hard and doing well to earns trust even if trust should be assumed. It doesnt mean i will or am capable of being a rockstar but

- lot more interesting than the culture map
  - makes me happy / reaffirmed behviour in a few sittuations i have found my self in poreviously where i how i responded probably didnt fit their method but would this (basically complaining in lack of excelense and how a product was a hack)
  - "Servant-leadership"
  - the rockstar analogy is a funny one

  New hire email

  Hi! I have been working in systems support / administration / enginering for all of my working life. From ISP's, Telco's, gaming, government, energy, risk engagement (sorry cant bring my self to say gmbling) and education but this is my first oppertunity to be working on the other side of the fence with a company really enabling cloud adoption so im super excited to be here!

  Outside of work, i'm a husband and father (2 & 3 yo... and 2 black labradores), single figure golfer, skier (if we ever get snow) and passionate supporter of my AFL team. Not so fun fact, im still working on / praying for a hole in 1 and for my AFL team win a grand final.
