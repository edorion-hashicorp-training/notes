# Recourse Quotas

-   **Rate Limit Quotas**: Limit maximum amount of requests per second (RPS) to a system or mount to protect network bandwidth
-   **Lease Count Quotas** (Vault Enterprise only): Cap number of leases generated in a system or mount to protect system stability and storage performance at scale

- quatas are per second and or tick so 30000 in a minute = 500 per tic
