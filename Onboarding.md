The Culture Map

Key communication context takeaway
- spectrum from low to high in general terms is east to west
- tip: document what is being or has been done clarifying it's there for future reference so to bridge low to high context communication

- probably more self reflective to personal style. like to think i match cultures subcontoiusly as i can be both contextually low and high


Competing with unicorns

- where does support sit in a mission based product methodology (unicorn)?
  - I would suggest support's role in a mission based org is as important inwardly facing as externally facing in comparison to a project one as not only are we focused on customers support but also assisting facilitate a product teams learning?
- What is our mission?
  - I would suggest it is that of the vault product teams not that of a support org

i lol'd as i remember a previous boss telling me he doesn't trust anyone


- lot more interesting than the culture map
  - makes me happy / reaffirmed behviour in a few sittuations i have found my self in poreviously where i how i responded probably didnt fit their method but would this (basically complaining in lack of excelense and how a product was a hack)
  - "Servant-leadership"
  - the rockstar analogy is a funny one
